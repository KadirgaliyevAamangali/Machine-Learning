kept a secret always stayed real and i appreciate how you raised me and all the extra love that you gave me i wish i could take the pain away if you can make it through the night theres a brighter day everything will be alright if you hold on its a struggle every day gotta roll on and theres no way i can pay you back but my plan is to show you that i understand you are appreciated  lady dont you
